PART A: TIMING
PROBLEM A.1: 
alice.txt, k = 1, 200 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 1, 400 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 1, 800 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 5, 200 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 5, 400 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 5, 800 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 10, 200 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 10, 400 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 10, 800 characters max:
hawthorne.txt, k = 1, 200 characters max:
hawthorne.txt, k = 1, 400 characters max:
hawthorne.txt, k = 1, 800 characters max:

PROBLEM A.2: 2.Based on these results, what is the relationship between the
runtime and the length of the training text, the k-value, and the max
characters generated? How long do you think it will take to generate 1600
random characters using an order-5 Markov model when the The Complete Works
of William Shakespeare is used as the training text — our online copy of
this text contains roughly 5.5 million characters. Justify your answer —
don’t test empirically, use reasoning.

PROBLEM A.3: Provide timings using your Map/Smart model for both creating
the map and generating 200, 400, 800, and 1600 character random texts with
an order-5 Model and alice.txt. Provide some explanation for the timings
you observe.

alice.txt, k = 5, 200 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 5, 400 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 5, 800 characters max:
alice.txt, k = 5, 1600 characters max:

PROBLEM A.4: Provide timings for the EfficientWordMarkov with different
hashcode methods. Time the method you are given and compare the results
that you achieve with the better hashcode method that you developed.

alice.txt, k = 5, 1600 characters max, basic hashcode:
alice.txt, k = 5, 1600 characters max, better hashcode:


PROBLEM A.5: Using a k of your choice and clinton-convention.txt as
the training text, if we do not set a maximum number of characters
generated (you can effectively do this by having maxLetters be a large
number, e.g. 1000 times the size of the training text) what is the
average number of characters generated by our Markov text generator?

PART B: HASHMAP VS. TREEMAP FOR EfficientWordMarkov
What are the differences in performance between HashMap and TreeMap as the
number of NGrams in the map grow?
